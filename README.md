# ‚ö° MERN E-commerce Platform | Full-Stack E-Store with Razorpay

## Overview

This project is a high-performance, full-stack e-commerce web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It demonstrates modern development practices, secure authentication flows, complex payment integration, and a dedicated administrator role.

The application is architected for scalability and is optimized for free deployment on Vercel (Frontend) and Render (Backend).

## üåü Key Features & Technical Highlights

### Authentication & Security
- **Secure Access**: JWT Access and Refresh tokens for session management
  - User sessions are secured using HTTP-only cookies for the refresh token,
- **Email Verification**: Ensures real users are signing up
  - Email verification implemented via Brevo SMTP and Nodemailer

### Payment & Business Logic
- **Razorpay Integration**: Complete, functional payment gateway
  - Implemented secure checkout using Razorpay SDK with server-side signature verification
  - Ensures payment legitimacy before order creation
- **Inventory Control**: Prevents overselling
  - Atomic logic to deduct product stock and clear the user's cart only upon confirmed payment success

### Architecture & User Experience
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Separates management from commerce
  - Dedicated Admin Dashboard for order fulfillment and product CRUD operations
- **Modern Frontend**: Fast, responsive design
  - Built with React (Vite) and styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional user interface
- **Product Catalog**: Full product lifecycle management (CRUD) backed by MongoDB

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20+)
- MongoDB Atlas account (M0 Free Cluster)
- Razorpay merchant account (for API Test Keys)
- Brevo (or other SMTP service) for email verification

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vai101/E-Commerce-Webapp.git
   cd E-Commerce-Webapp
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the `/backend` directory and populate it with your keys (see Environment Variables section below).

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install Backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Install Frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend API** (Runs on port 5000):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run server
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Client** (Runs on port 5173):
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **MongoDB** - Database with Mongoose ODM
- **JWT** - Authentication tokens
- **Razorpay** - Payment gateway integration
- **Nodemailer** - Email service
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing

### Frontend
- **React** - UI library with Vite build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **Axios** - HTTP client
- **React Context** - State management

## üö¢ Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on every push to main branch

### Backend (Render)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Configure environment variables in Render dashboard
3. Set build command: `npm install`
4. Set start command: `npm start`

## üîê Security Features

- **JWT Authentication** with access and refresh tokens
- **HTTP-only cookies** for secure token storage
- **Password hashing** using bcryptjs
- **Email verification** before account activation
- **Payment signature verification** for Razorpay transactions
- **Environment variable protection** for sensitive data

## üìß Email Configuration

The application uses SMTP for sending verification emails. Configure your preferred email service:

### Using Brevo (Recommended for free tier)
1. Sign up at [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/)
2. Get your SMTP credentials
3. Add to your backend `.env` file


## üí≥ Payment Gateway Setup

### Razorpay Configuration
1. Create account at [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/)
2. Get Test API keys from dashboard
3. Add keys to environment variables
4. For production: Switch to Live API keys

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MongoDB Connection Error**
- Verify MongoDB URI format
- Check network access in MongoDB Atlas
- Ensure IP whitelist includes your deployment platform

**Payment Integration Issues**
- Verify Razorpay API keys
- Check webhook configuration
- Ensure proper signature verification

**Email Verification Not Working**
- Verify SMTP credentials
- Check email service provider settings
- Ensure sender email is verified
